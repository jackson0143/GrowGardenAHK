# 🚀 Roblox Automation Script (AHK)

This is a Grow A Garden automation script inspired by  [Virage's Grow A Garden Macro](https://github.com/VirageRoblox/Virage-Grow-A-Garden-Macro/).
Automatically realigns the player's positions and camera, auto-buy Seeds, Gears, Eggs, etc. 

Future plans to add more when I have time

## ⚙️ Requirements

✅ [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)  
Make sure you have **AutoHotkey v1.1** on your machine, as most existing Roblox AHK scripts run on 1.1 and is stable.
